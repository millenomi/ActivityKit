/* Choreographies are activities that handle a single- or multi-step UIKit animation. When started, they execute all animation and completion blocks in a UIView animation block.
 
   Since animation is complex, subclasses can override the -main method to set up the animation themselves. Subclasses can then use the -invokePreparationBlocks, -invokeAnimationBlocks and -invokeCompletionBlocksWithResult: methods to invoke any added animation or completion blocks. You can also perform multiple, chained or parallel animations. No matter what you do, it's this method's responsibility to call -end after all blocks have been invoked.
 
   The default implementation runs animation blocks with the following settings: a duration of 0.25; ease-in-out easing; default options otherwise. The default implementation invokes completion blocks and calls -end when this animation ends.
 
   Choreographies may be cancelled like any other activity. However, the default implementation does NOT stop animations right away, as it overrides -cancel to do nothing. To implement cancelling in a subclass, override -cancel entirely without calling super.
